# Azure Support Scripts
A collection of scripts I have personally written while either supporting Microsoft Azure customers or managing my own personal Azure environment.

## Install
These scripts require the use of the Azure Powershell module.

For basic instructions on the module (including install, update, and usage), see the [Azure Powershell README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/blob/master/README.md).

Alternatively, you can use Azure CloudShell. For more information [see this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview).
